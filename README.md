Fig.1 Lithium Battery Capacity Prediction Framework Based on DTW-Time-Frequency Feature Weighting and Diﬀusion Model
We proposes a diﬀusion model framework incorporating capacity regeneration phenomena and time-frequency feature weighting for lithium-ion battery capacity sequence prediction, eﬀectively addressing prediction deviations caused by capacity regeneration.
